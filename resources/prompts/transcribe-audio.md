# Audio Transcription

This prompt uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe audio files into text.

The transcription is performed by sending the audio file directly to the OpenAI API.

Output will be returned as plain text and can be used in text fields or for further processing.

Note: No specific prompt engineering is needed as the Whisper model is specifically designed for transcription.
